# NQueensPuzzle_ILP
Formulates the N-Queens Puzzle as a 0-1 Integer Linear Program and solves it using the SCPSolver + GLPK tools.

(TODO: Readme stuff here, links to blog, picture of command line usage, etc.)

This program uses the following open source libraries:
- the SCPSolver developed by Hannes Planatscher and Michael Schober (http://scpsolver.org/),
- the optimization backend chosen for the SCPSolver is the GNU Linear Programming Kit (https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) originally developed by Andrew Makhorin.

Those software libraries are licensed under the GNU GPLv3, and so is this program.
