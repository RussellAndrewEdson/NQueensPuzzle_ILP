# NQueensPuzzle_ILP
Formulates the N-Queens Puzzle as a 0-1 Integer Linear Program and solves it using the SCPSolver + GLPK tools.

(TODO: Readme stuff here, links to blog, etc.)

This program uses the SCPSolver (http://scpsolver.org/) developed by Hannes Planatscher and Michael Schober,
and the backend is the GNU Linear Programming Kit (https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) originally developed
by Andrew Makhorin. Those software libraries are licensed under the GNU GPLv3, and so is this program.
